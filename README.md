# Assignment Overview: Lab 8

Here's some of the steps you'll need to take, but not necessarily in this order:

&#10004;- Add the necessary HTML to create the input form.

&#10004;- Don't forget \<fieldset>!

&#10004;- Use the constructor function as your guide to determine what input fields your form needs (hint: also consider what is passed in when creating instances!)

&#10004;- Your JS will need an event listener and and event handler, and also a variable to facilitate DOM access to the form.

&#10004;- As we saw in class, the event handler should take the data from the input field, pass it into the constructor function, and create a new instance of a cookie stand that then appends to the table.

&#10004;- Are you going to do any error correction on input? You probably should. Look at what kind of input validation is built in to HTML5.

&#10004;- Build incrementally. Test frequently.

&#10004;- Be attentive to overall code structure.

&#10004;- This is a good point to refactor your code into smaller functions/methods if you have some huge functions going on. Remember that each function should do one thing, and then you can compose more complex behavior out of functions.

&#10004;- Anywhere you have repeated chunks of code, maybe you can start to apply some DRY principles. Generally, once some chunk of code is appearing for a 3rd time or so, that's when you want to consider refactoring.

&#10004;- When making code more DRY, look for repeated behaviors that act on different pieces of data. Put the behavior into a function that is declared with parameters to receive the unique data, and then replace the repeated code with the function called with the unique data in arguments.

&#10004;Submit your assignment through Canvas as usual.
